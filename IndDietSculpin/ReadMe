This folder contains code for the analysis of individual-level sculpin data from the NovakLab.

The goal of this project is two-fold: 1) we are interested in temporal dynamics of individual diets and variation among individual's diets,
2) we are trying to extend the method published in Coblentz et al. 2017 to account for differential detection times and 
availability among prey types.
